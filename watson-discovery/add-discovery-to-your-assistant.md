# Add Discovery to your Assistant

### Before

* Be sure to demo a \#PolicyInquiry in the app/TryIt/preview before adding the search skill returning some dumb hard-coded response.

### Use the Search Skill

* Prereq: Make sure the document used here was loaded as part of the intro
* Document steps to add the VIA search skill to the students dialog
* Note: I think we can do this without SDU first.  Need to see if that is effective for learning.

### Try it!

* Students see that the chatbot was extended
* Without SDU this might not be very good.
