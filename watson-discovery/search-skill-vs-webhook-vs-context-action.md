# Integration patterns for developers

We have 3 ways we do this integration and pretty good example we can share, but need to consider whether we want to share more than one \(our learning paths include all 3 in some form\).

1. Search skill is a good example and probably preferred.
2. Webhook is probably not preferred, but is a good technique for non-Discovery call-outs.  So it is worth learning.
3. Context actions give the developer the most control and are a good exercise for playing with the SDK and code.
