# Register and log in to IBM Cloud

For workshops there are specifics for registration...

1. Make sure everyone is "in"
2. Briefly show/explain:
   * The service catalog
   * Provisioning services
   * IAM credentials for services
3. Demonstrate basic navigation

TODO: Decide if this is when everyone spins up their services or should it be in the later sections.  Dealing w/ Cloud vs CPD differences complicates a bit so having details here might help.
